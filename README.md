# Web Audio Engine

This project started as an educational initiative to rethink and improve the implementation I previously made in [blibliki](https://github.com/blibliki/engine) while deepening my understanding of WebAudio. However, it has now evolved into a full replacement for the previous implementation.

One of the main reasons for this change is that [blibliki](https://github.com/blibliki/engine) is built on top of Tone.js, which I wanted to move away from. My goal is to build the engine directly on top of WebAudio, giving me better control and a deeper understanding of how it works.

Additionally, this approach allows my engine to run in Node.js through [node-web-audio-api](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/node-web-audio-api).

I have also written blog posts covering some core concepts of my engine:
