## Overview

Blibliki is a web audio project that provides a framework for building synthesizers and audio applications. This monorepo contains multiple packages that work together to create a complete audio development ecosystem.

## Key Packages

### [Engine](/packages/engine)

The core audio engine built directly on the Web Audio API. It provides a modular, data-driven approach to audio synthesis with support for:

- Oscillators, filters, envelopes, and other audio modules
- MIDI device integration
- Polyphonic synthesis
- Node.js compatibility

### [Grid](/apps/grid)

A visual interface for the Blibliki Engine that allows users to create and connect audio modules through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Features include:

- Visual patching of audio modules
- Real-time parameter control
- MIDI device connectivity
- Patch saving and loading
- User authentication

```

## Getting Started

This project uses PNPM for package management and workspace handling.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development servers for all packages
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build
```

## Development

Each package has its own README with specific development instructions. In general:

- The engine package can be developed independently
- The grid application depends on the engine package
- Changes to shared packages require rebuilding dependent packages
